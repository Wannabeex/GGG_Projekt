General:

Still need to conclude playtesting (currently at Plantkin (doesnt keep poison when missing))
Maybe Overload weapon and trinket methods to avoid having 1 object with 100 parameters. //Implemented for now
Add Dictionary to Status.sC[] and PlayerMoveset (isG, etc.) see EnemyMoveset.


MapTravel:

Movement gets confused when fight starts (thinks it moved when it didnt).	//Fixed. Problem with order of code 
Random Text spacing issues when encounter starts.	//Fixed. Old code residue rolled for Encounter after n, e, s , w path
Coloring Last cell in map still doesnt work. //Fixed


Combat:

Random Text offset (row -1) //Fixed 
Killing yourself will result in slight corruption due to the game not expecting you to die on your turn.
/Optional. Change Reward so that WIN text appears before choosing weapon. //Implemented
Seen one time not recreated Goblin Warlock used Dark Bolt to heal/pray until mana ran out. //Outdated issue
When starting new floor gets a index out of bounds exception.	//Fixed gStartFlag had to be true for some reason
Charm Timer might not work properly.
For the time being unique boss attacks only apply to attacktype 1 (Spells)
Icy Winds needs to be calculated in attacktype 1 (Spell) even when the enemy uses attacktype 0 (hit) //Implemented
When "Stunned" can't use inventory and other issues. //Fixed
Line 148 yet to see logistic effects of this change. //Working
Structure change in initializing the enemies not yet working. //Fixed
Goblin Warlock, Assassin and King broken. //Fixed (Forgot space in name)
Merfolk Siren broken. //Fixed
Guard may get applied through stun. //Fixed
Killing enemy while stunned will bug out combat.


CombatText:

Inventory sometimes breaks no idea why. //Possibly Fixed


PlayerMoveset:

Changes made to the Combat System have yet to be fixed and adjusted. //Fixed.
Opening inventory after attack breaks for some reason. //Fixed (pAttacktype wasn't being changed so it repeated an attack)


Status:

Change debuff back to status //Implemented
Status class still an unsolved mystery.


Reward, Items, Inventory:

Weapons etc. should be made in Items, added to a list in inventory and have parameter inpossession changed in Reward to finally add a dmg modifier to Combat. //Implemented (outdated issue)
Weapons break after some time (gives effect of last weapon and unable to switch also doesnt remember switching). //Fixed.


Enemies and Bosses:

Need to add Plantkin + subspecies and bosses for each race. //Added
	->Bosses missing.
		->Alpha Red Wolf (summons minions -> Fight 1v1 (Battle doesnt end after eH=0))
		->Ogre Warchief (1st Phase Mage -> 2nd Phase Meele (same mechanic as above))
Adjust Plantkin Sunflower. //Adjusted
Plantkin Goliath added, Bugfixes. //Fixed
	-> Overhaul needed.
Change back Temporary cases in Encounter and Combat.
Fix Plantkin Goliath (Bind seems to be somewhat broken).


ERRORS:
-Multiple Errors to be fixed //Fixed
